    name: "Ron Weasley", type: "Companion",
    description: 'Summons Ron. Ron charges on his knight piece, pulls all enemy units in and deposits them behind him. When a number of enemy units have been defeated on the chessboard, Ron will summon a chess piece. Ron Weasley will never let you down when it comes to a game of Wizard Chess.',
    guide: 'Good for dealing with mobs of monsters. When he is cast against me, I like to wait until he is in my Cassandras circle and stop him with inflatus. He usually dies before he can finish his charge. Incendio or expuslo also works well against him.',
