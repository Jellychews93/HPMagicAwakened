        Newt: Fantastic Duels and How to Win Them
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant='h5'>
        Technically, as long as your newt deck is filled with creatures, it will have a decent chance to work out fine. However we will dig into the finer points of what makes a good newt deck.<br />
        Newt excells in the &apos;zerg rush&apos; strategy, where the aim is to fill the field so full of creatures that enemy has no heads or tails on what to kill first, and every attempt at kiting the creatures just means getting attacked every step of the way from different angles. Hence, slow creatures or creatures with high cost are not recommended to be included into newt decks. (Looking at all of you Opal Eye, Piertotum Locomotor, Dragon Egg and Fiendfyres....)<br />
        Although "Fast" is the keyword here, Newt could use some immobile creatures to great effect too. Like Firework Box, Acromantula Nest or Whomping Willow. But these are counter measures for going against creature decks. Their value diminishes greatly when up against spell decks. Which is why we will not include them in our sample build.<br />
        I will provide you with the sample build of Ashwinder Newt
        <br /><br />
        ⭐Central Cards:<br />
        Ashwinder, Bombtastic Bomb
        <br /><br />
        + Supports:<br />
        <br />Niffler
        <br />Phoenix ＊ (this is complicated. we will explain later)
        <br />Golden Snitch＊(not available)
        <br />Manticore
        <br />Matagot
        <br />Pixie
        <br />Monster Book (primarily to pierce nebulus. books have low damage and are really frail, spend mana elsewhere until necessary)
        <br />Centaur
        <br />Blast Ended Skrewt
        <br /><br />

        ~ Techs:<br />
        <br />Acromantula Nest (against grounded creature decks, like Hagrid Fiendfyre/Statues, or Neville Dragon Egg)
        <br />Firecrab (creatures in general, good at tanking thunderstorm)
        <br />Whomping Willow (slightly more useful against spell deck, can tank thunderstorm but badly)
        <br />Firework Box
        <br />Crucio

        Scamander&apos;	s Burnt Chicken<br />
        <br />Wait a minute, but what about including ___ (insert creature name here)?
        <br />Oh, you mean things like Fwooper, Troll, Unicorn, Erumpet, Thunderbird and countless other creatures that have not been listed?
        <br />Sorry to say, but they are just not good creatures overall.
        <br />Newt&apos;	s echo effect will randomly create thunderbirds and erumpets for you. For 1 mana cost. There is no reason to draft the actual thunderbird or erumpet cards into the deck.
        <br />Troll is too slow, Unicorn takes too long to heal (and gets countered by atmosphere charm and venom). Fwooper is too frail and flies around randomly, potentially sending enemy creatures into random directions as well. Though Fwooper is very excellent at countering enemy creature decks, it is still a frustrating card to use and easily killed with 2 mana oppugno or 3 mana cards. Most damning is the fact that these are all 5 mana. Too costly but not providing much value in return.
        <br />Spiders and Occamy is Just Bad™️. Stack of Monster Book of Monsters takes 7 mana but dies to a single cast of Incendio which is 4 mana, putting you at a 3 mana disadvantage. Please don&apos;	t ever use stack of books with Newt.
        <br />Swelling Solution?
        <br />Not necessary. You could use it if you want, but Bombtastic Bomb is so much better, and we are already using Bombtastic Bomb.

        <br />Consequently, Manticores (after they finish dancing) grant a substantial speed boost to anything nearby. A well timed Manticore dance finish can make your pixies and matagot blazingly fast along with Bombtastic Bomb.

          <br />For companions, we suggest Lottie or Cassandra first. Again, Cassandra is bad against spells but good against creatures.
          <br />Ron second, OR, bring Ivy as second companion. Ivy can vanish enemy Ron, and since most people put him as the second companion, Ivy is placed second to counter him. If you really hate Ron for sweeping away all your creatures, consider including Ivy.
          <br />Hagrid or Prof. McGonagall (once she becomes available) as 3rd. And yes, Prof. McGonagall can trigger off creatures too. Which is why she is also valuable addition for Newt.
          <br />Video samples of me playing Newt (I forgot to remove Hagrid as first companion, that was embarrassing :IvyCry: )

          <br /> Putting aside the fact that some cards are not available, the general strategy is clear:
          <br /> You play a few creatures, then once you have a couple of echo generated 1 mana cards in hand, and an Ashwinder (or are about to draw the Ashwinder), wait till 10 mana. Then place down Ashwinder, and quickly spam all of the other cards.
          <br /> When against spells, place Ashwinder closer to the center so the little fire snakes can reach the wizard at the backline.
          <br /> When against creatures, place Ashwinder further back, since enemy creatures will be running towards us you don&apos;t need to place Ashwinder too close and put them in danger.
          <br /> Personally I found that the sequence of: Ashwinder + Bombtastic Bomb + Niffler, then spamming all the 1 mana cards, to be my most comfortable way to play.
          <br /> Sadly, Golden Snitch is not available. So the spam will be a lot slower. But it should still be frightening to go up against.

          <br />Echo Bonuses for Newt
          <br />Whatever your central card is. For this sample deck, it happens to be Ashwinder and Bombtastic Bomb.
          <br />Then, in order of importance: Matagot, Pixie, Acromantula Nest/Whomping Willow, Firecrab. And literally any other creature under the sun that you could feasible include into your deck. (that are not named in the &apos;why not these creatures?&apos; section)
          <br />Addendum: echo bonus no longer apply to generated cards, sorry guys. Don&apos;t aim for thunderbird or erumpet bonus now.

          <br />What&apos;s up with phoenix?
          <br />Phoenix, on its own, is a very bad card actually. However it brings some very interesting side benefits, of which we are aiming to take advantage of right now.
          <br />The hidden function of phoenix is that it compresses your deck. every deck must contain 8 cards. But if you have phoenix, after playing phoenix it does not cycle back into the deck anymore until it dies three times. This essentially makes your deck become only 7 cards temporarily at the cost of spending 7 mana.
          <br />This is very important because if your deck is 7 cards and you can arrange your card order correctly, it will loop seamlessly, and you will always get the cards you want. however if you have 8 cards, then there is an element of RNG in your card cycling, there is a chance that you wont get the card you want.
          <br />This is very advantageous for decks that aim to cycle through cards quickly to spam their cards. Of which we are doing with our Ashwinder Spam.
          <br />Consequently, some Harry or Hermione decks included Phoenix! Yes, they did. And they also were aiming to compress their deck through phoenix. However I&apos;ve never personally liked them. So for any brave souls wanting to experiment with quick-cycle Harry or quick-cycle Hermy, this is the clue of one of their gimmick. Good luck figuring out the rest of the deck.
