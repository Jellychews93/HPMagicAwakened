        <br />Currently the global meta does not meet the requirements for Dobby decks (of any variety) to flourish. Please avoid playing Dobby... for now.
        <br />But this is a guide on deck building. So here I will mention the MOSTE DREADED, MOSTE TERRIFYING deck in all HPMA meta: The Avada Dobby.
        <br />It is due to the notoriety of Avada Dobby that Dobby has been nerfed many times, but Avada Dobby is eternal. The nerfs make it more difficult for Avada Dobby to survive long enough to stack avada fully, but once it is stacked, still no stopping skilled Avada Dobby players.
        <br /><br />
        ⭐Central Cards:<br />
        <br />Avada Kedavra
        <br />GOLDEN SNITCH＊
        <br />Inflatus
        <br /><br />
        + Supports:<br />
        <br /> Nebulus (hide from creatures, thunderstorm)
        <br /> Incarcerous (not quite as important as Inflatus, but still has its uses)
        <br /> Prior Incantanto (potentially double Avada, quicker stacking)
        <br /> Cheap spells to quickly cycle through deck, including but not limited to:
        <br /> Oppugno, Broom, Expulso, Snowball, Expelliarmus, Stupefy, Portkey, etc.
        <br /> Niffler
        <br /> Blast Ended Skrewt (basically Three Headed Dog but discount with movement)
        <br /> Episkey (heal self while teleporting around)
        <br /> Phoenix (quicker cycling for faster Avada stacking)
        <br /> Bludger (easy to catch with your teleport. Good damage to clear creatures and harass wizard)
        <br /> Confringo
        <br /> Incendio
        <br /> Sectum Sempra
        <br /> Tebo Assault (literally the only echo to ever use this card)
        <br /> Accio
        <br /> Aquamenti
        <br /> Matagot
        <br /><br />
        ~ Techs:<br />
        <br />Acromantula Venom
        <br />Atmosphere Charm
        <br />Crucio
        <br />(Disclaimer: I never could handle playing Dobby. It didn&apos;t click for me and I&apos;m bad at it. The following sample deck is probably very bad for actual Avada. Take it with extra grain of salt.)

        <br />As you can see, it includes the Golden Snitch. The Golden Snitch is the absolute core of Dobby gameplay in general. Without it, Dobby echo is borderline unplayable.
        <br />Dobby echo will let you teleport/apparate every two movement card, and leave behind a clone that will counter attack for slightly increased normal attack damage.
        <br />This means that Dobby is extremely reliant on having movement cards to take advantage of his peerless mobility (straight up teleportation), but also runs out of movement quickly if you aren&apos;t careful.
        <br />It is possible to use Kevin to boost the clone counter attack, and increased normal attack in general will allow Dobby an easier time to clear swarm of creatures. Other companions like Cassandra or Frey Twins or Grawp can be considered as well.
        <br />Ron is used to clear creatures. Dobby is scared of creatures, and too many creatures will mean Dobby is dying or make it harder to snipe enemy wizard.
        <br />Ivy on slot 3 is very important. Hagrid Bike can block Avada for wizard ONCE. Increased movement speed and immunity to control effects while on bike makes inflatus+avada impossible. Use Ivy to vanish Hagrid&apos;s bike and snipe enemy wizard.

        <br />Avada? Stacking?
        <br />Yes. Avada is a single target spell that hits for high damage. Every time you land a killing blow, Avada&apos;s damage increases by 25%. Eventually after landing a total of 4 killing blows with Avada, it becomes fully charged and any future Avada will instantly kill the target regardless of health, including enemy wizard.
        <br />However 6 mana is really costly, not to mention needing to cycle through your deck again to draw Avada. Even with flawless execution, usually it takes around 2 minutes and more to fully charge it.
        <br />The difficulty is doubled in actual duels because there are a lot of things going on, needing to dodge, needing to neutralize enemy attacks, calculating best position to move, to snipe, calculating mana and card cycle..... Avada Dobby is super hard.

        <br />Avada (in general) is terrible in three situations:
        <br />When enemy just doesnt give you anything to kill. No creatures, no companions, nothing for you to stack buffs on. Pure spell decks like Harry and Hermy can just decide to withhold the Three Headed Dog, or not play companions. Although you could just Avada them for the damage and kill them the normal way, you are still at a disadvanatge
        <br />When enemy throws waaaaay too many creatures in your face. Like Newt&apos;s creature zerg rush strategy. Avada can only shoot one by one, smart Newt players could try and interrupt you with Erumpet, so unskilled players will just die before they make it to max stack and snipe the wizard with it. Oh and, its hard to snipe the wizard through the wall of all the minions.
        <br />Avada is terrible on echoes that are not Dobby or Hermione. However, due to the lack of golden snitch, I strongly discourage using Avada with these echoes at all; and since no other echo can utilise Avada well, this just means don&apos;t use avada in general. (at least until golden snitch comes out)
        <br />Avada excels in winning against Mixed decks that lean towards more spells with a few creatures, but struggles when its full spell or full creature, or mixed with few spell and extra creature.
        <br />Does Manticore help Dobby?
        <br />Not really. Manticore also disables teleportation while the dance is going on. I don&apos;t know how &apos;disabling your own echo effect&apos; will count as being helpful for Dobby. But Bludger Dobby decks could use Manticore to compensate, I guess.
        <br />Defying Canon: Dobby HARD COUNTERS Bella
        <br />You heard that right. Though Bellatrix kills Dobby in Canon, here in HPMA, Bella stands absolutely no chance against Dobby. Her multi-hit spells cannot touch him as he teleports around, her choice of creatures usually speedy but frail and thus easy fodder for Avada Stacking, teleportation can easily run away from Death Eaters. Basically 95% of Bella&apos;s winning conditions are invalidated by Dobby echo&apos;s high mobility.

        <br /> Showcasing Avada Hermione
        <br /> Unlike Dobby who naturally has teleport built into their echo effect, Hermione must use Side Along Apparition to convert one existing movement card into teleport. This means she needs to spend 3 mana to do this, but that is okay because thanks to Hermy&apos;s discount effect, she turns Avada 6 cost into 3 cost, so it evens out. She also has an easier time clearing creatures, because she can just slap on convenient cards like Incendio Sectum Sempra or even Confringo without losing too much value.
        <br /> But again, no golden snitch is a bummer. And required skill floor is very high, this deck should not to be attempted by the clumsy or faint hearted.
        <br /> Intricacies of Sniping with Avada
        <br />Every time you teleport, your character will face the direction you click depending on which direction you&apos;re teleporting from. It&apos;s a bit hard to explain, but think of the dueling field in terms of a XY graph, where high-low is X, front-back is Y. The most important thing is to calculate your Y when you teleport, and the way you face will be changed depending on the direction of X position trying to find the most efficient way to keep you facing toward the direction you click.
        <br /> Anyway, since I really don&apos;t know how to explain it in a way that people could undersyand, I made a video and tried my best to show the correlation between the direction you teleport and the direction the avada will shoot after teleport.
        <br /> Addendum from @ Kateberly (thanks a bunch Kateberly):
        <br />Where you face after you teleport is relative to the place you chose to teleport, based on your original position.
        <br /> ie. if you teleport left you face left.

        <br /> Calculating Mana for full Avada combo
        <br />If you&apos;ve watched both of the Avada killing spree video played by players who are much more skilled in Avada than I am, you would have seen some fancy things like Inflatus+Avada or the super difficult Inflatus+Expulso+Avada. I will attempt to explain how it is done here.
        <br /> For Dobby players, Inflatus+Avada is naturally gonna take 9 mana. So saving for 9 mana is really important. Trying to add Expulso into the mix takes a total of 11 mana, which is impossible under normal circumstances, and will only be an option after dueling for more than 1 minute and 30 seconds (when you enter the &apos;mana speed up&apos; phase). You also need to be SUPER LUCKY to have niffler or golden snitch provide you with one extra mana at exactly the right time. Thanks to Inflatus control effect being juuuust long enough for you to wait for one extra point of mana for the necessary Expulso+Avada, you can squeeze it into the combo and knock enemies out from behind their wall of creatures.
        <br /> Hermy has a much easier time, since she can discount avada into a 3 cost, she just needs 6 mana for the Inflatus+Avada, and 8 mana for Inflatus+Expulso+Avada. However she can&apos;t get teleportation movement on demand, needing side along apparition to be set up beforehand.
