// What is Double Thunderstorm? And Triple Thunderstorm?
// Prior Incantanto allows you to copy a spell you previously used. Through precise control of card rotation, it is possible to play two thunderstorms in quick succession. This is known as the double thunderstorm. To achieve this, the sequence of cards should be:

// Cheap, cheap, cheap, buff the thunderstorm but don't play it yet.
// Then, cheap, cheap, discounted thunderstorm, into discounted prior incantanto copied thunderstorm.

// The Hermione companion will immediately use an identical spell when you put her down and cast a spell. So Hermy companion is required to achieve triple thunderstorm.

// (In the future, after Dumbledore companion releases, its possible to achieve quadruple thunderstorm, because dumbledore will enhance a spell you cast to trigger twice. So its dumble-enhanced thunderstorm that triggers twice + priori thunderstorm + hermy companion thunderstorm)

// Newt: Fantastic Duels and How to Win Them
// Technically, as long as your newt deck is filled with creatures, it will have a decent chance to work out fine. However we will dig into the finer points of what makes a good newt deck.

// Newt excells in the 'zerg rush' strategy, where the aim is to fill the field so full of creatures that enemy has no heads or tails on what to kill first, and every attempt at kiting the creatures just means getting attacked every step of the way from different angles. Hence, slow creatures or creatures with high cost are not recommended to be included into newt decks. (Looking at all of you Opal Eye, Piertotum Locomotor, Dragon Egg and Fiendfyres....)

// Although "Fast" is the keyword here, Newt could use some immobile creatures to great effect too. Like Firework Box, Acromantula Nest or Whomping Willow. But these are counter measures for going against creature decks. Their value diminishes greatly when up against spell decks. Which is why we will not include them in our sample build.

// I will provide you with the sample build of Ashwinder Newt

// ‚≠êCentral Cards:
// Ashwinder, Bombtastic Bomb

// + Supports:
// Niffler
// Phoenix Ôºä (this is complicated. we will explain later)
// Golden SnitchÔºä(not available)
// Manticore
// Matagot
// Pixie
// Monster Book (primarily to pierce nebulus. books have low damage and are really frail, spend mana elsewhere until necessary)
// Centaur
// Blast Ended Skrewt

// ~ Techs: 
// Acromantula Nest (against grounded creature decks, like Hagrid Fiendfyre/Statues, or Neville Dragon Egg)
// Firecrab (creatures in general, good at tanking thunderstorm)
// Whomping Willow (slightly more useful against spell deck, can tank thunderstorm but badly)
// Firework Box

// Wait a minute, but what about including ___ (insert creature name here)?
// Oh, you mean things like Fwooper, Troll, Unicorn, Erumpet, Thunderbird and countless other creatures that have not been listed?

// Sorry to say, but they are just not good creatures overall.

// Newt's echo effect will randomly create thunderbirds and erumpets for you. For 1 mana cost. There is no reason to draft the actual thunderbird or erumpet cards into the deck.

// Troll is too slow, Unicorn takes too long to heal (and gets countered by atmosphere charm and venom). Fwooper is too frail and flies around randomly, potentially sending enemy creatures into random directions as well. Though Fwooper is very excellent at countering enemy creature decks, it is still a frustrating card to use and easily killed with 2 mana oppugno or 3 mana cards. Most damning is the fact that these are all 5 mana. Too costly but not providing much value in return.

// Spiders and Occamy is Just Bad‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. Stack of Monster Book of Monsters takes 7 mana but dies to a single cast of Incendio which is 4 mana, putting you at a 3 mana disadvantage. Please don't ever use stack of books with Newt.

// Swelling Solution?
// Not necessary. You could use it if you want, but Bombtastic Bomb is so much better, and we are already using Bombtastic Bomb. 

// Consequently, Manticores (after they finish dancing) grant a substantial speed boost to anything nearby. A well timed Manticore dance finish can make your pixies and matagot blazingly fast along with Bombtastic Bomb.

// For companions, we suggest Lottie or Cassandra first. Again, Cassandra is bad against spells but good against creatures. 

// Ron second, OR, bring Ivy as second companion. Ivy can vanish enemy Ron, and since most people put him as the second companion, Ivy is placed second to counter him. If you really hate Ron for sweeping away all your creatures, consider including Ivy.

// Hagrid or Prof. McGonagall (once she becomes available) as 3rd. And yes, Prof. McGonagall can trigger off creatures too. Which is why she is also valuable addition for Newt.

// Putting aside the fact that some cards are not available, the general strategy is clear:

// You play a few creatures, then once you have a couple of echo generated 1 mana cards in hand, and an Ashwinder (or are about to draw the Ashwinder), wait till 10 mana. Then place down Ashwinder, and quickly spam all of the other cards.

// When against spells, place Ashwinder closer to the center so the little fire snakes can reach the wizard at the backline.

// When against creatures, place Ashwinder further back, since enemy creatures will be running towards us you don't need to place Ashwinder too close and put them in danger.

// Personally I found that the sequence of: Ashwinder + Bombtastic Bomb + Niffler, then spamming all the 1 mana cards, to be my most comfortable way to play.

// Sadly, Golden Snitch is not available. So the spam will be a lot slower. But it should still be frightening to go up against.

// -----

// Echo Bonuses for Newt
// Whatever your central card is. For this sample deck, it happens to be Ashwinder and Bombtastic Bomb.
// Then, in order of importance: Matagot, Pixie, Acromantula Nest/Whomping Willow, Firecrab. And literally any other creature under the sun that you could feasible include into your deck. (that are not named in the 'why not these creatures?' section)

// What's up with phoenix?
// Phoenix, on its own, is a very bad card actually. However it brings some very interesting side benefits, of which we are aiming to take advantage of right now.

// The hidden function of phoenix is that it compresses your deck. every deck must contain 8 cards. But if you have phoenix, after playing phoenix it does not cycle back into the deck anymore until it dies three times. This essentially makes your deck become only 7 cards temporarily at the cost of spending 7 mana.


// This is very important because if your deck is 7 cards and you can arrange your card order correctly, it will loop seamlessly, and you will always get the cards you want. however if you have 8 cards, then there is an element of RNG in your card cycling, there is a chance that you wont get the card you want. 

// This is very advantageous for decks that aim to cycle through cards quickly to spam their cards. Of which we are doing with our Ashwinder Spam.

// Consequently, some Harry or Hermione decks included Phoenix! Yes, they did. And they also were aiming to compress their deck through phoenix. However I've never personally liked them. So for any brave souls wanting to experiment with quick-cycle Harry or quick-cycle Hermy, this is the clue of one of their gimmick. Good luck figuring out the rest of the deck.

// Time turner will create a clone that normal attacks automatically, but at half of your damage. This is fine though, since your echo already boosts your normal attack damage. And with Kevin, your attack damage will rise even higher. So high in fact that you will never need to bring Confringo to deal with creature swarms; maybe only need the occasional Expulso or Incendio to kill creatures placed too far away from you. 

// The main strategy is to put your time turner in the center of the field so it can reach enemy wizard hiding in the back line, as well as any creature back there. I prefer Firecrab Snape mostly because firecrabs will restrict enemy's field of movement, they either move into firecrab range or move into snape attack range or time turner clone attack range. Whomping Willow is great as well because it periodically tries to pull enemy forward, saving you a cast of Accio.

// OH MY GOD! THEY KILLED kenny KEVIN!!
// (again)
// Once you place down Kevin, he will start to 'record' how many times you have done a normal attack. After 24 times, you will receive his full normal attack damage buff. However, if Kevin dies, you will still receive a buff, though it will be much less.

// Kevin's recording occurs in 6 tiers, and depending on how many times you attacked before he dies, you will receive a small boost. In theory, every four attack will advance the record by one stage. At stage 6 you gain full buff. If your Kevin dies before you get full buff, your chances of victory will literally plummet. Which is why snape is overall not a popular echo for dueling. He is so much better in Forest Explorations.

// There are an unfortunately high amount of ways to torment Kevin. Kevin is a sitting duck, a single cast of Acromantula Venom will see him dead unless your level is way higher than the enemy. An Accio can pull him forward into slapping range. Swarming creatures could reach him before you manage to fully stack your normal attack buff. He could die to a Whizbang or Avada to the face. etc.etc.etc.

// Some Snape players try to protect him by placing down Protego Totalum, or put the Whomping Willow in front of Kevin, or bring healing spells to heal him, Side Along Apparition to relocate him. etc. Success may vary, but at the end of the day..... Oh my God They killed Kevin!!(again)

// Echo Bonuses for Snape?
// Priority is always Kevin, then Time Turner.

// Then seek bonuses on any of the support cards that you like to use.

// Giving Kevin one or two extra levels gives him extra HP which could often mean the difference of surviving enemy attacks, and a higher buffed normal attack damage, which is good for us. 

// Although higher levelled time turner only increases Clone health, if clone survive longer = more chance to normal attack, so its still good for us.

// Neville: St. Mungo Neville's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries
// Neville's normal attack has a special function where if there are no enemy units nearby, it will instead heal friendly units within attacking range. Additionally, since this 'healing' normal attack is still considered a normal attack, it can be boosted by Kevin's buff. Which is why a vast majority of Neville decks will include Kevin and Time Turner.

// But unlike Snape decks where the K&T (kevin time turner) combination is mandatory, this is not the case for Neville. It is a possible strategy that is helpful for Neville, but he is hardly beholden to it. Time turners are often included without Kevin.

// Nevilles should endeavour to use creatures that lose health to function, or start with missing health to maximise his potential. Unicorn and Dragon Egg were clearly designed for Neville in mind. For this guide, we will include a Dragon Egg Neville deck that can easily be adapted into Unicorn if you don't have egg. (Though unicorn is far inferior) 

// Try and keep nifflers alive as long as you can. Dragon egg is a hefty 7 cost card, and Whomping Willow, Time Turner, Protego Totalum cost 5. You will want all the mana you can get. Ideally Golden Snitch is included, but global no snitch. We get the drift.

// All your companions love (Professor) Neville
// Neville synergizes very well with many companions and would dearly wish he could bring more than three. 

// We've already mentioned Kevin, so we will skip that. Slot 1 if you do bring him.

// Lottie will generate mana by decreasing her own health. As Neville, we can continuously heal her (and nearby nifflers and golden snitches) for a continuous stream of free mana. If you want to bring her, we recommend slot 1 or 2.

// Daniel is necessary for late game, to instantly hatch a dragon egg and help hatch any future eggs during 'regen speed up' phase. He will be good at slot 2 or 3.

// Cassandra is a very good bodyguard for Neville and can deal with swarms of creatures for a very long time as long as you support her properly. If you want to bring her, we recommend slot 1 or 2.

// Ivy can be used to vanish annoying Rons trying to crash your mobile hospital. She will be good at slot 2 or 3. (Ivy can also be used to vanish enemy Hagrid's Bike, so your dragons have easier time attacking wizard)

// For Neville, Ron brings immediate value by sweeping away creatures, but cannot generate additional value like any of the other companions listed above. Use Ron if you really can't handle creatures despite having Cassandra.

// Same for Hagrid. Good immediate value, but not what we're looking for. You can use him, but whatever you do, DO NOT kick Daniel to make room for Hagrid. For dragon eggs, Daniel is very powerful for hatching.

// Nebulus and Side Along Apparition and Protego Totalum
// Hide inside Nebulus to let Lottie and Dragon Egg work in peace. Nebulus will also block Atmosphere Charm, Thunderstorm, and Confringo. Atmosphere Charm and Thunderstorm have a -60% healing received effect, which heavily hinders the hatching of the dragon egg. Confringo is dangerous since our creatures and companions will be close to each other and are liable to die in that big chain of explosions.

// The corner stone of a good neville is being smart about Side Along Apparition... which we will shorten down to Apparition, and Protego Totalum. If enemy throws acromantula venom onto your egg and companions, relocate to a safer corner. If enemy tries to whizbang, apparate away or shield with protego totalum. And vice versa.

// Another strategy is to avoid putting eggs in the same basket, by putting eggs and companions in different corners. Use time turner clones to heal a different corner. Like you standing near dragon egg, while clone stands near Kevin. Enemy will have to decide whether to whizbang kevin OR the egg, and not both. However this is match up dependent, and will not always work. There is a risk of spreading yourself too thin and losing everything.

// The key is to not be at 0 mana. Always keep some reserve mana at all times. So instead of waiting for 7 mana and putting down an egg then get hit by whizbang, you wait for 10 mana, put down the egg, hold Apparition in hand, teleport away when enemy tries to whizbang.

// Oh yes. Glacius Maxima will shoot off additional ice beams from your time turner clones and any existing companions. However Neville decks tend to have many hefty cards, and Glacius Maxima really isn't that good. Snape will never want to use Glacius Maxima since normal attack damage is much more consistent and better overall, but Neville is one of the only echo that could potentially use Glacius Maxima. The other is Glacius Maxima Hermy (with time turner, without kevin), but that is mostly a meme deck.

// How good is Neville in dueling actually?
// He is not very good. Neville suffers immensely from card level power creep. If his card level is not higher than enemy, his chances of victory are greatly reduced. And if enemy happens to be higher level, then your prospects become extremely thin. Whizbang could break Protego Totalum bubble before the final hit. A dragon could hatch, but just dies to high level acromantula venom. Your Whomping Willow or Cassandra cannot withstand high level swarm of creatures and your line of defense falls apart....... The list goes on.

// If you do not have high level cards in general, we do not suggest playing Neville at all.

// Wait, what about Occamy and Thunderbird?
// Thunderbird expends health to grant a shield, which is nice, but they are much too frail. They cannot survive long enough for Neville to heal them. Occamy attack too slowly, tend to miss moving targets, have low health, and the damage isn't even that great. Occamy bad. Don't play Occamy.

// Bombtastic Bomb expends health to create bombs, which is a good thing since we are Neville. But it is also rather frail, and its difficult to fit into Neville's deck, so it is mentioned as a viable support card but rarely included in actual Neville decks.

// Bonuses?

// Neville and Swelling Solution?
// This is a 'maybe'. It CAN synergize well with Neville, but he usually doesn't have enough space in the deck to include it. Include or exclude per your preferences.

// Question of the Day: How do I counter Neville?
// Atmosphere charm plus either Incendio or Acromantula Venom is the answer that most echoes will use. Hermy thunderstorm can include either atmosphere charm or just destroy egg with Incendio. Hermy Whizbang can just Whizbang (if enemy doesn't have Apparate/Totalum). However, the next Echo that I am about to introduce is not only strong in their own right, but will also heavily counter Neville. 
// Bellatrix: Killing by a Thousand Cuts
// Bella's echo effect involves dealing as many multiple-hit attacks as possible to quickly charge her Death Eater Gauge. Each time you inflict damage, it increases by 1. If you inflict damage against Player Wizards (including Time Turner Clones, but not wizard companions), it increases by 4. Once the bar is filled, she will summon one death eater, the next time it is filled, summon two, until finally she can summon up to three death eaters each time the bar is full. Death eaters will fire off powerful Crucios for you, that you don't need to channel the spell or spend mana for. Due to the fact that she gets quicker charges from time turner clones, she heavily counters Snape and Neville who rely on them, and will easily win against those two echoes unless you misplay (or somehow meeting those two but DONT use time turner, but nobody in their right mind do this).

// The crucio damage of the death eaters WILL ESCALATE up to four times. Each time the damage increases by 35% (same effect as the actual spell), so its only going to hurt more and more as the game goes on and she summons more death eaters more often.

// Bella is the mistress of the mixed deck archetype, as she can lean into both pure spells, pure creatures, and anything in between. As long as it can hit more than once, its a possible choice to include in her deck.

// There are many ways to build her. Thunderstorm Bella is a thing, Bludger Bella is a thing, Creature Swarm Bella (mostly copying the Ashwinder Newt deck) is a thing. Listing the number of ways to build a Bella deck will face a similar problem with Snape's "theoretically too many choices" of support cards, but it's not exactly the cards that determine her success, rather how you handle the not-very-well-hinted/explained mechanics of her Death Eaters that determine your success in Bellatrix.

// Kiki's Deadly Delivery
// Under normal circumstances, when Bellatrix summons death eaters, they will usually touch down on her side of the field, generally behind or beside your wizard. However it is possible to deposit death eaters into enemy side of the field through the use of Broom (and in the future, a certain card called Obscurus). Oppugno+Broom at around 90~95% death eater gauge will ensure it will be summoned on the other side. However, the timing of this combo is very strict, it is much easier to do with Obscurus. Master the Death Eater air delivery, and you will Master Bella.

// Gold Echo takes less 'charges' to reach full bar (124 charges for gold echo), so use Gold Echo Bella if you can find one.

// Successful Air Deliveries are also very important when going up against Neville. Instead of letting them walk slowly and be intercepted by the likes of Cassandra, Willow, or Firecrab, deliver them right onto the doorsteps of Neville, and let him experience first-hand how you turned his parents into vegetables. 

// Death Eaters meander slowly towards your enemies, so depositting them on enemy side of the field is crucial if you want to increase your win rate as a Bella player. Bombtastic Bomb will boost speed (and yes, it benefits the death eaters too!), and Manticore dance can boost speed when its done. Adding Matagot that is already fast on its own rounds up the core of the deadly delivery strategy.

// The theoretical maximum damage of Bludger is really high, so do not underestimate its damage output. Just from that video alone, I used bludger four times and dealt a total of 1789 damage, while matagot that came in second only dealt 935.

// However Bludger will 'lose target' if enemy hides in Nebulus. I attempted to deal with that by using Venom to deny enemy Nebulus, but I misplayed on that part. (I don't like monster book Okay!? I didn't want to use it to break nebulus)

// Monster Book is a grounded unit that cannot touch pixies, a unit that is highly popular in creature decks. Monster book can be kited with ease. Monster Book is frail. Monster Book damage is pitiful (although it can hit really quickly). Monster Book costs 3 mana and can be neutralised by Expulso (with a few more slaps of normal attack) or one cast of Oppugno, which are 2 mana cards. People can hide in Nebulus again (after kiting said book away from the nebulus).

// As mentioned in the Newt section, Stack costs 7 mana, but can die to 4 mana Incendio, Venom, Sectum Sempra. Harry could kill them with buffed Expulso or Stupefy or Snowballs, 2 or 3 or 3 mana. Hermy's Thunderstorm (6 mana, technically 3 due to discount) can zap them silly, whizbang (7 mana, technically 4) would be a waste but kills them too. Confringo is 5 mana and can kill them. Pixies are 3 mana. Firecrab are 5 mana. Ashwinder is 3 mana (plus a few more mana to spawn smaller snakes). People can walk a bit further away and hide inside 2 mana Nebulus. They can be neutralised with 3 mana Incarcerous or Inflatus. Even 6 mana Opal Eye can deal with them since its Airborne.

// More on Bella and Death Eaters
// Bella's Death Eater gauge has a 'cool down' after you fill and summon death eaters. It will go green, and rapidly go down. During this 'green' period, your bar WILL NOT CHARGE no matter how many attacks you land. Try to avoid over-expending resources at that point in time, like throwing out 10 mana's worth of spells or creatures for example. 

// The level of your summoned death eaters will be your total average deck level (level of all cards in the bella echo deck, averaged). Do your best to include all your highest level cards that are still relevant to Bella's needs. Please avoid shenanigans like lv15 Episkey just to boost average. You're not gonna use it. Your Death Eater has attack range identical to regular wizard and regular companions. This means its just a tiny bit longer than Cassandra's slapping range. They could eventually poke her down if left alone. 

// Your death eaters are quite frail, but its okay if they die so long as they managed to 'initiate' a crucio on enemy wizard. Even if they don't zap crucio until the very end, it still allows crucio damage to escalate by 35% for any future zapping. 

// Death Eater AI is kind of dumb. They will automatically try to Crucio anything they first walk in range to. It is possible to misdirect death eater Crucio by placing a more convenient target within their range. For example, see approaching Death Eaters? Throw out a niffler and walk backwards out of range, with only niffler within range it zaps the niffler and spares you. (You monster) A very good scapegoat for this scenario is Matagot. Instead of dying, it splits in two. Throwing a cat at death eaters will keep them distracted.

// Death Eater CAN Crucio again given enough time (imagine a cool down similar to Hermione Companion, taking a bit longer). But since death eaters are really frail, this doesn't usually happen. If you are against a Bella, its better to kill them than to delay them, with say, Stupefy or Ventus.

// Echo Bonus is same old. Bonus for your central cards first, then your support cards. Due to the number of possible Bella deck variations, there is no good rule of thumb here except that anything with Multi-hit is nice, any creature that is quick or hits many times is good. Things that hit once, creatures that are slow, or have no offensive value (avada, troll, healing spells/phoenix) are all bonuses you should avoid.

// Heyyyyy I saw Orb of Water mentioned for the first time in this guide.....
// The problem of orb of water is that its 6 mana, yet can be easily interrupted or neutralized by cheap spells like Broom, Expulso, Portkey(random), Stupefy, Incarcerous, Inflatus, Expelliarmus, Side Along Apparition, Tebo Assault (if Newt), Accio, Howler. All of which are much much cheaper than Orb of Water. Additionally, Orb of Water burns through movement cards like craaaaaazy, there is a high chance you run out of movement cards and become a sitting duck at the middle of the duel. 

// One possible build is the Manticore Orb of Water. With Manticore enabling you to move without spending movement, increased movement speed for better dodging, it makes it slightly safer to use Orb of Water with Bella.

// Since Orb of Water hits many times, it accumulates your charges decently quickly. It can also stop enemies from running away, which means easier access for Death Eaters to zap with crucio. It is a build that works, but not one I recommend.

// Crucio (spell) with Bella?
// 5 mana is on the costly side, and it is also easily interrupted by all the aforementioned cards that stops Orb of Water. Not to mention the power of just running away out of range. Perhaps Manticore will help here. It is rather redundant though; you couldve included some other utility card that might be more helpful than the pure raw damage of Crucio. Unless you picked it specifically for Ron or Fiendfyre. Then sure, whatever I guess.

// As you can see, it includes the Golden Snitch. The Golden Snitch is the absolute core of Dobby gameplay in general. Without it, Dobby echo is borderline unplayable.

// Dobby echo will let you teleport/apparate every two movement card, and leave behind a clone that will counter attack for slightly increased normal attack damage.

// This means that Dobby is extremely reliant on having movement cards to take advantage of his peerless mobility (straight up teleportation), but also runs out of movement quickly if you aren't careful. 

// It is possible to use Kevin to boost the clone counter attack, and increased normal attack in general will allow Dobby an easier time to clear swarm of creatures. Other companions like Cassandra or Frey Twins or Grawp can be considered as well.

// Ron is used to clear creatures. Dobby is scared of creatures, and too many creatures will mean Dobby is dying or make it harder to snipe enemy wizard.

// Ivy on slot 3 is very important. Hagrid Bike can block Avada for wizard ONCE. Increased movement speed and immunity to control effects while on bike makes inflatus+avada impossible. Use Ivy to vanish Hagrid's bike and snipe enemy wizard.

// Yes. Avada is a single target spell that hits for high damage. Every time you land a killing blow, Avada's damage increases by 25%. Eventually after landing a total of 4 killing blows with Avada, it becomes fully charged and any future Avada will instantly kill the target regardless of health, including enemy wizard.

//  ‚Äî 07/04/2023 12:23 AM
// Avada (in general) is terrible in three situations:

// When enemy just doesnt give you anything to kill. No creatures, no companions, nothing for you to stack buffs on. Pure spell decks like Harry and Hermy can just decide to withhold the Three Headed Dog, or not play companions. Although you could just Avada them for the damage and kill them the normal way, you are still at a disadvanatge

// When enemy throws waaaaay too many creatures in your face. Like Newt's creature zerg rush strategy. Avada can only shoot one by one, smart Newt players could try and interrupt you with Erumpet, so unskilled players will just die before they make it to max stack and snipe the wizard with it. Oh and, its hard to snipe the wizard through the wall of all the minions.

// Avada is terrible on echoes that are not Dobby or Hermione. However, due to the lack of golden snitch, I strongly discourage using Avada with these echoes at all; and since no other echo can utilise Avada well, this just means don't use avada in general. (at least until golden snitch comes out)

// Avada excels in winning against Mixed decks that lean towards more spells with a few creatures, but struggles when its full spell or full creature, or mixed with few spell and extra creature. 
// Does Manticore help Dobby?
// Not really. Manticore also disables teleportation while the dance is going on. I don't know how 'disabling your own echo effect' will count as being helpful for Dobby. But Bludger Dobby decks could use Manticore to compensate, I guess.

// Defying Canon: Dobby HARD COUNTERS Bella
// You heard that right. Though Bellatrix kills Dobby in Canon, here in HPMA, Bella stands absolutely no chance against Dobby. Her multi-hit spells cannot touch him as he teleports around, her choice of creatures usually speedy but frail and thus easy fodder for Avada Stacking, teleportation can easily run away from Death Eaters. Basically 95% of Bella's winning conditions are invalidated by Dobby echo's high mobility.

// Unlike Dobby who naturally has teleport built into their echo effect, Hermione must use Side Along Apparition to convert one existing movement card into teleport. This means she needs to spend 3 mana to do this, but that is okay because thanks to Hermy's discount effect, she turns Avada 6 cost into 3 cost, so it evens out. She also has an easier time clearing creatures, because she can just slap on convenient cards like Incendio Sectum Sempra or even Confringo without losing too much value.

// But again, no golden snitch is a bummer. And required skill floor is very high, this deck should not to be attempted by the clumsy or faint hearted.

// Intricacies of Sniping with Avada
// Every time you teleport, your character will face the direction you click depending on which direction you're teleporting from. It's a bit hard to explain, but think of the dueling field in terms of a XY graph, where high-low is X, front-back is Y. The most important thing is to calculate your Y when you teleport, and the way you face will be changed depending on the direction of X position trying to find the most efficient way to keep you facing toward the direction you click. 

// Anyway, since I really don't know how to explain it in a way that people could undersyand, I made a video and tried my best to show the correlation between the direction you teleport and the direction the avada will shoot after teleport.

// Addendum from @ Kateberly (thanks a bunch Kateberly):
// Where you face after you teleport is relative to the place you chose to teleport, based on your original position.

// ie. if you teleport left you face left.

// Calculating Mana for full Avada combo
// If you've watched both of the Avada killing spree video played by players who are much more skilled in Avada than I am, you would have seen some fancy things like Inflatus+Avada or the super difficult Inflatus+Expulso+Avada. I will attempt to explain how it is done here.

// For Dobby players, Inflatus+Avada is naturally gonna take 9 mana. So saving for 9 mana is really important. Trying to add Expulso into the mix takes a total of 11 mana, which is impossible under normal circumstances, and will only be an option after dueling for more than 1 minute and 30 seconds (when you enter the 'mana speed up' phase). You also need to be SUPER LUCKY to have niffler or golden snitch provide you with one extra mana at exactly the right time. Thanks to Inflatus control effect being juuuust long enough for you to wait for one extra point of mana for the necessary Expulso+Avada, you can squeeze it into the combo and knock enemies out from behind their wall of creatures.

// Hermy has a much easier time, since she can discount avada into a 3 cost, she just needs 6 mana for the Inflatus+Avada, and 8 mana for Inflatus+Expulso+Avada. However she can't get teleportation movement on demand, needing side along apparition to be set up beforehand.

// Hagrid: The Not-so-gentle giant Dreadnought
// Hagrid's echo effect involves boosting the most expensive creature in your deck, giving them extra attack speed and a healing factor that triggers when the creatures reaches 50% health, this healing can occur twice. In the case of having multiple creatures with identical costs, only one random creature (that you can't determine until actually playing them) will benefit from this echo effect.

// This effect is best paired with expensive and bulky creatures, because being bulky means they are less likely to immediately die before/while healed, and the healing in general will heal for more HP.

// The common mistakes of newbie Hagrids are the following: 
// putting in multiple creatures of the same cost (Fiendfyre+Dragon egg ; Piertotum Locomotor+Opal EyeÔºä)
// putting creatures that are not suitable for Hagrid in general (Opal EyeÔºä)
// putting in way too many creatures when you realistically only needed less than four types.

// Hagrid is one of the representative echoes for the Mixed deck archetype but generally leaning towards SPELLS. Like in Fiendfyre, you bring fiendfyre, spiders, maybe pixie or matagot, then the rest should just be spells. Full creature fiendfyres will get their ass kicked, so don't build full creature fiendfyre, okay?

// Why are you against Opal Eye in Hagrid?
// Opal eye is rather frail for a 6 mana creature, and often cannot survive long enough for Hagrid's healing factor to kick in. To put into context, much cheaper cards like Incendio and Sectum Sempra are almost capable of one-shotting Opal Eyes. Follow it up with something like Oppugno or Stupefy and it will be dead before it can regenerate health to survive any other spells. You can get much better value out of Piertotum Locomotor and Fiendfyre.

// And Egg?
// Easy counter with Atmosphere Charm. You can't even save egg with Portkey because you might end up sending egg to enemy side of field to its death.

// We will be writing about Fiendfyre Hagrid, because Hagrid is literally the only echo that will ever use fiendfyre. No other echo should include fiendfyre in their deck. Just don't.

// Fiendfyre will get stronger when something dies while its alive, which means we want cheap and plentiful creatures like Spiders, Pixies, Matagot, and Manticore.

// Spiders is actually a super awful card, and no one in their right mind should be using them. However, the mere fact that it summons 6 units at once cements their place within the Hagrid Fiendfyre archetype, there simply is no other substitute for this quick 6 unit.

// Manticore can summon 4 units and after the dance is finished, apply a movement speed buff to anything nearby. This is helpful for Fiendfyre because it moves really slowly, and no reason to not have 4 units feed it.

// You can adapt this deck into Piertotum Locomotor or Dragon Egg by switching out Fiendfyre and Spiders. What card to replace spiders? ANYTHING. Spiders are that bad.

// For this sample deck, we didn't include Pixies or Matagot, instead bringing Inflatus and Incendio for direct damage. Spiders+Manticore is 10 units. You might wish to switch for creatures if you find Fiendfyre isnt getting fed quickly enough to your liking. We don't really need Fiendfyre to be fully fed. Being fully fed allows it to attack three targets, which is better against creatures but not that helpful against spells. If you're up against creatures, enemy units can feed you anyhow. 

// Portkey is crucial for the survival of Fiendfyre. Acromantula Venom is a card that heavily counters Fiendfyre, and we are using Portkey to randomly relocate it to somewhere else. Of course, theres a chance that you are super unlucky and the Fiendfyre is teleported back into the venom puddle again, but there really isnt any other choice. Side Along Apparition only works while its within your side of the field after all. This also helps with Atmosphere Charm, but to prevent Atmosphere Charm to slowly home back onto the Fiendfyre once its done teleporting, YOU the wizard, need to stand under the Atmosphere Charm (if you can; not gonna work if its on enemy side of field) to prevent it from sticking back onto Fiendfyre. This is trading a bit of your health for the survival of your central strategy.

// To play fiendfyre, ALWAYS WAIT FOR 10 MANA. Then you play both fiendfyre and spiders together, in that order. You should bring fiendfyre out first, wait a little bit to see if enemy wants to acromantula venom or incendio or Ron or whatever, if the coast is clear then you play spiders, if the coast is not clear you play portkey.

// To ensure your Fiendfyre can continuously put pressure on enemy, use Episky to heal it. If you are going up against Whizbang Hermy, you can choose to Episkey early (before 50% that triggers healing factor) because Whizbang has enough damage to kill at 50%, so you should heal it to stay above executing range, or Portkey to escape whizbang or Ron.

// F00k these Whales with max level Fiendfyre Hagrid. How do I counter them?
// Atmosphere Charm and Acromantula Venom are highly recommended. You can also try Crucio, though this card is much harder to include for certain echoes, and Fiendfyre CAN survive a Crucio if they have immense level advantage or are backed up by Episkey, or relocated by Portkey.

// Buying yourself time to slap it with normal attack with Nebulus, Expulso, Stupefy is very important, then once it reaches about 50% range for the healing, you use atmosphere charm. Or wait until 60%~55% and use a very powerful card to execute it, like Incendio or whizbang.

// Neville, when played well, can stop Fiendfyre in its tracks, unable to pressure Neville while he hatches more and more dragon eggs to counterattack. Try Neville if you have trouble against Hagrid.

// How to deal with Fiendfyre if I'm playing creature deck?
// Since you could hardly include Acromantula Venom, you will have to settle for Acromantula Nest. The little spider leave behind puddles of Venom. You just let the little spider die, then once Fiendfyre walks into the puddle, walk forward and let it attack you, or throw out a creature to distract it (this ensures it stops moving out of the puddle), with your normal attack it should die really soon.

// Bombtastic Bomb is also a viable answer. A sufficient swarm of creatures with multiple bombs will be able to kill the Fiendfyre in record time. Unfortunately this is a pyrrhic victory and does not work if enemy has much higher level than you. Which is why Crucio is a viable tech card listed in the newt section of the guide.

// Hagrid Echo Bonus?
// Fiendfyre, and whatever central card you picked.
// Spiders does not need bonus. Portkey does not need bonus.

It's mostly due to card level power creep that enables Hagrid to bully other players. In a perfect world where card levels are all equal, Hagrid will always lose against skilled players. 

// Neville especially counters Hagrid. Neville's superb defensive capabilites mean that any big bulky creature Hagrid brings out will be worn down, or unable to break through the Protego Totalum+Apparition core to actually prevent Neville from accumulating more advantages.

// Online PVP games across all genres all use a synced level system. Pokemon locks everyone at lv50, even if fine tuning by IV/EV and move sets is a thing. 

// Player account levels (summoner levels) dont impact gameplay in league of legends and other DOTA. 

// Medieval fighting games like For Honor and what not arent going to give you extra HP or stronger damage because you got higher levels. 

// Online gambling games like mahjong everyone starts at 25000 points and I doubt online poker will give extra chips to players due to levels. 

// Online racing games that are not gacha cash grabs wont give you better or faster cars due to levels. 

// Strategy games like cid meiers civilization or crusader king isnt going to give you better starting tiles because youre a player who pumped one thousand hours into the game 

// But no. HPMA uses players levels, and then each card have card levels.

// Its like playing yugioh where neither player starts at 8000LP, and each card have power boosts depending on what 'level' it is, instead of having the ATK/DEF for what is written on the card, and having extra effects due to levels and not because its written on the card. Or magic the gathering. Or pokemon TCG. Or gwent.

// Twins are all about Value and battle of attrition. The longer you survive, the more frequently you can use your randomly replenishable companions to swing the advantage into your favor. Twins can use companions slightly earlier than others, they will have a bit more HP. So picking cards that have bigger value than their advertised cost is very important for twins, because you don't have an echo effect to strengthen any of your regular cards.

// Which is why I suggest Matagot and Acromantula Nest. These two are Big Value‚Ñ¢Ô∏è cards. Matagot is fast, hits hard, very sticky, and less likely to die to a single spell often needing two spells or more to kill, forcing enemy to waste extra mana. Acromantula Nest will constantly create little spiders that leave puddles of venom behind, its damage and zoning potential is really good.

// Then I decided to include the Bludger and Manticore combo, because Bludger's damage is pretty significant, and having Manticore to help alleviate movement card restriction, and dodging in general, will ensure you survive long enough to spam companions.

// For companions, we suggest Grawp and Twins and Hagrid. Despite the fact that twins technically can use companions for unlimited amount of time, these three are picked because of their highest value in general.

// That's all folks!
// This has been Introduction to Deck Building, and I hope you all learned something from reading all of it. See you next time!
// Oh, and please direct any further discussion or questions into the ‚Å†‚ú®charms-talk or other channel. If we start chatting here its only going to get longer and longer (it's already 75 posts here!) then navigation will be a nightmare.

// And if any of you are wondering "Hey, what about 2v2?", well the decks are mostly the same, but you need to add more tech cards like Confringo or Acromantula Venom to deal with creature swarms. Try those tech cards yourself, pick one or two you like, and learn to play around creatures through smart kiting or targetting. So I decided to not explain them in the main entries.

// Professor McGonagall is here!
// As of 2023/07/15, prof mcg. has arrived in global. Remember how I mentioned her in Harry, Hermy, Newt deck? This is what it looks like:

// https://youtu.be/3gjKKlnttDc

// Basically, save till 10 mana, spam cards.

// While prof mcg. CAN function in slot 2, it is generally better to put her in 3rd for max value, because being in 2nd means she will be just a bit too early for mana regen speed up phase (1:30), and cant profit from it. Generally you can get two locomotor if you put her 3rd, but only one statue when 2nd. As you can see in the final match with Newt VS Dobby, she came off cool down at 1:00. Unless you purposely waited 30 seconds (which is big value loss), you won't be able to have her within the mana speed up phase. But its okay to use her 2nd if your aim isnt extra statue.

// If you are behind, she can swing some situations around for you, but not always. It is especially difficult when up against opponents with higher level cards in general.

// She is comparatively frail (same health as Hermy), also easily dies to direct assault, such as a venom or incendio. Standing too close to try body block for her is also liable to set off Confringo or Sectum Sempra. After a short while when she walks out of her corner, its also really easy to just expulso her into the center of the field into slapping range, same with just a straight up well aimed Accio or Harry's boosted Bewitched Snowballs or Hermy's Whizbang.

// Although Prof McG. can put all creatures on the screen on time out with transfiguration, she only delays the inevitable and will still be in danger if you do not take advantage of that window to clear the field. Her random transfiguration won't protect her from a creature swarm for too long.

// Her value is highest when against spell decks, or mixed decks with minimal creatures, where each random transfiguration won't have any other target except the enemy wizard, and thus constantly apply a slow and extra damage taken debuff on wizard.

// The Importance of SLAPPINGü´≤ THATü´± NIFFLERüñêÔ∏è
// Disclaimer, this is not a post intended on propogating needless niffler cruelty.... but the unfortunate truth is that in HPMA, niffler cruelty is a necessity. 

// The function of niffler is very intuitive. You summon it for 2 mana, it stays around for a while and digs up mana by spending health, able to dig up to 3 total mana if they have been left alone and uninjured through the entire time. This means you will receive a net gain of 1 mana.

// This means that as long as we attack it, we can significantly reduce the total amount of mana it will produce. Injuring it enough to produce 1 mana or killing it before it can produce any will eventually swing the situation into our advantage, because the enemy has not been able to gain any mana from it, and in fact summoned the niffler at a loss. It's still a cheap card used to cycle your deck though, so that's nice.

// Theres also the fact that usually one must spend more than 2 mana to actually kill the niffler. Oppugno is a good trade but would only work if it wanders too close to the center field, so usually broom is needed to tackle it in the back, spending 4 mana to kill a 2 mana creature (with potential 3 mana total value) is honestly not a good trade; same with using Sectum Sempra to bounce and kill the niffler, but sometimes needs must. Expulso can reduce it enough to only produce 2 mana, so its also kind of an equal trade.

// In the future, Golden Snitch will be pretty much the same. It's a 5 cost card that if left unscathed can produce up to 6 mana (and 8 movement cards), so you should always try to at least smack it for a bit, to ensure enemy gains less total mana from Golden Snitch. Golden Snitch has a tendency to fly to the center of the field and loiter there for a long time, so as long as you havent lost the field to a creature swarm or something you can always take the opportunity to walk up and slap it.
