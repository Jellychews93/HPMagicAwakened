  { name: 'Mystery Wheel', src: mysteryWheel, description: 'Honestly this wheel is kind of a waste of resources. Yeah the cosmetics are pretty neat but in terms of value, you are losing much more than you are getting. But of course after saying this I rolled like 30 times and get the wand so Im pretty happy. Go watch some youtubers experience rolling.' },
  { name: 'Mystery Wheel Items', src: mysteryWheelItems, description: 'Here you can see what is available. There are a total of 90 items. IF you get all 4 legendary items, you will get EVERYTHING else.' },
  { name: 'Monthly Card', src: monthlyCard, description: 'This is the most worth it in terms of dollars to resources ratio. You get quite a lot of stuff for the price. Definitely worth it if you plan on playing daily.' },
  { name: 'Bundles', src: bundles, description: 'If you have jewels or gems to spend, this is where you should be spending them. On average I think you get at least a 20% discount on these bundles. The bundles rotate daily so you can get some interesting stuff like Gold bundles or different key bundles.' },
  { name: 'Magical Studies', src: magicalStudies, description: 'This is where you spend your golden and silver keys. I personally do not really save my keys and just spend them whenever I feel like' },
  { name: 'Daily Items', src: dailyItems, description: 'You get one free daily item every day here so dont miss out! I like to get the bottom right card for gold option every once in a while depending on what it is. I personally dont think the legendary cards are worth the price. I guess if you have gold to spare then sure but I would rather use the gold on leveling my spellbook.' },
  { name: 'Thank You Note Exchange', src: thankYouNote, description: 'This is where you spend the thank you notes you get from running the forbidden forest with allies. I personally recommend you get the curious card pack, the gold, and legendary trade token.' },
  { name: 'Jewels', src: jewels, description: 'This is where you buy the p2w currency, jewels. You should definitely go for the bundles here since they give you extra jewels the first time you purchase it. If you spend enough money, on the left there is a loyalty rewards thing where you can get costmetics and goodies.' },
