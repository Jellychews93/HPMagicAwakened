I noticed there is a severe lack of resources for the game Harry Potter Magic Awakened so I decided to build a one stop site with most resources needed. 

Built the site using Next.js and MUI. The navbar was built using TailwindCSS. 

Looking for other developers/content writers to help add to the site! Please message me or fork the repo and make a pull request if you'd like to contribute!
